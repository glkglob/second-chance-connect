## Validated RTF Prompt

### Context for AI Agent

You are an AI software engineer tasked with continuing development of **Second Chance Connect**, a production-ready Next.js application for employment reintegration. The frontend, API layer, and authentication infrastructure are complete. Your role is to guide the next phase of implementation.

### Current State

The application has a **stable build** with:
- 37+ pages with responsive design
- 8 API endpoints with authentication guards
- Role-based middleware protection
- Complete UI component library
- Defined database schema (not yet provisioned)

### Immediate Objectives

1. **Provision Supabase database** by executing SQL scripts in sequential order (001-004)
2. **Configure environment variables** for Supabase connection (URL and anon key)
3. **Conduct end-to-end authentication testing** across all four user roles
4. **Validate API endpoint functionality** with proper authentication and RLS enforcement
5. **Deploy application to production** (Vercel recommended) with secure HTTPS
6. **Execute smoke tests** in production to verify core user flows

### Development Workflow

```
Step 1: Review DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md for detailed setup instructions
Step 2: Create Supabase project and apply database schema from scripts/ folder
Step 3: Update .env.local with NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL and NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
Step 4: Start development server and test authentication flow for each role
Step 5: Test API endpoints using curl or Postman to verify CRUD operations
Step 6: Deploy to production and conduct final validation
Step 7: Monitor application logs and address any runtime issues
```

### Architecture Patterns

**Routing:** Use Next.js App Router with role-based middleware protection. All dashboard routes require authentication and role verification.

**Data Fetching:** Client components use custom hooks (`lib/hooks/*`) that call API routes. Server components can use Supabase server client directly.

**Authentication:** Supabase Auth handles user management. Middleware (`middleware.js`) protects routes and enforces role-based access.

**API Design:** RESTful endpoints in `app/api/*` use server-side Supabase client. All routes check authentication and apply RLS policies.

**Database Security:** Row Level Security (RLS) policies ensure users only access their own data. Never bypass RLS in application code.

### Code Conventions

| Aspect | Convention |
|--------|-----------|
| **File Extensions** | App routes: `.jsx`, UI components: `.tsx`, Utilities: `.ts`, Hooks: `.js` |
| **Imports** | Always use `@/` alias for absolute imports. Import Supabase clients from `lib/supabase/` |
| **Styling** | Use Tailwind CSS utility classes exclusively. Follow design tokens in `globals.css` |
| **Components** | Prefer shadcn/ui components from `components/ui/`. Use shared components from `components/` |
| **Error Handling** | Return proper HTTP status codes. Log errors with `console.error` |

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Sign up as each role (SEEKER, EMPLOYER, OFFICER, ADMIN)
- [ ] Verify email confirmation flow works correctly
- [ ] Test role-based dashboard access and redirects
- [ ] Create job posting as EMPLOYER and view as SEEKER
- [ ] Submit job application as SEEKER and review as EMPLOYER
- [ ] Send messages between users and verify delivery
- [ ] Test RLS policies prevent unauthorized data access
- [ ] Verify logout clears session and redirects to login
