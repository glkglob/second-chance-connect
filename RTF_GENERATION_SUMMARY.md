## Component Dependency Mapping

### Authentication Flow
```
Entry: /auth/login, /auth/sign-up
  ↓
Dependencies: Supabase Auth, middleware.js, lib/supabase/server.js
  ↓
Outputs: User session, Profile record, Role-based redirect
```

### Role-Based Routing
```
Middleware: middleware.js
  ↓
Database: profiles.role column
  ↓
Routes:
  - SEEKER  → /dashboard
  - EMPLOYER → /employer
  - OFFICER  → /officer
  - ADMIN    → /admin
```

### API Layer
```
Client Components → Custom Hooks (lib/hooks/*) → API Routes (app/api/*)
  ↓
Server Supabase Client → Database (with RLS)
```
